🚀 **New Project Release: Tactical Edge Communications Gateway (TacEdge-Gateway)**

I'm excited to share my latest defense-focused systems engineering project: a **Zero Trust tactical communications platform** designed for secure message routing in mission-critical environments.

**🎯 Key Features:**

🔐 **Zero Trust Architecture**
- JWT-based service authentication with role-based access control
- No implicit trust between microservices
- Service-to-service identity verification

📡 **Military-Standard Message Precedence**
- FLASH (<100ms) → IMMEDIATE → PRIORITY → ROUTINE
- Priority-based queuing and guaranteed delivery ordering
- Store-and-forward for disconnected operations

🔒 **Cryptographic Security**
- AES-256-GCM encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation
- End-to-end message integrity verification
- HMAC-SHA256 signatures

📋 **NIST 800-53 Compliance**
- Mapped to AC, AU, IA, SC, SI control families
- Structured audit logging with tamper-evident storage
- Compliance-ready documentation

☸️ **Cloud-Native & Kubernetes-Ready**
- Containerized microservices with multi-stage Dockerfiles
- Kubernetes manifests with network policies
- CI/CD pipelines with security scanning (Trivy, Bandit)

🖥️ **Tactical Operations Dashboard**
- Real-time message queue visualization
- Network node health monitoring
- Audit event timeline

**💡 This project demonstrates:**
✅ Systems engineering & architecture design
✅ Zero Trust security implementation
✅ Container security & DevSecOps
✅ FedRAMP/NIST compliance alignment
✅ Microservices communication patterns

## ClearanceJobs Summary

**Project: Tactical Edge Communications Gateway (TacEdge-Gateway)**

**Technologies:** Python, FastAPI, AES-256-GCM, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, NIST 800-53

**Description:**
Designed and implemented a containerized, Zero Trust tactical communications gateway platform for secure message routing in defense and mission-critical environments. The system features military-standard message precedence handling (FLASH, IMMEDIATE, PRIORITY, ROUTINE), AES-256-GCM encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation, and comprehensive NIST 800-53 compliant audit logging mapped to AC, AU, IA, SC, and SI control families.

**Key Accomplishments:**
- Engineered JWT-based Zero Trust authentication with role-based access control (RBAC)
- Implemented store-and-forward message queuing for disconnected/degraded network operations
- Built Kubernetes-ready microservices with network policies and Pod Security Standards
- Created CI/CD pipelines with automated security scanning (Trivy, Bandit, pip-audit)
- Developed real-time tactical operations dashboard for message queue and node health visualization

**Relevance:** Demonstrates hands-on experience with Zero Trust architecture, container security, compliance controls (NIST 800-53), and systems engineering for defense environments.
