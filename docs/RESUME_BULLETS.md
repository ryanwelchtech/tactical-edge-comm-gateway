# Resume Bullet Points - Tactical Edge Communications Gateway

## Quantifiable Metrics for Defense Industry Recruiters

### Bullet Point 1: Zero Trust Architecture & Security Implementation
**Engineered a Zero Trust tactical communications gateway platform implementing JWT-based authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and service-to-service identity verification across 5+ microservices, achieving 100% authenticated inter-service communication with zero-trust boundary enforcement aligned to NIST 800-53 AC, IA, and SC control families.**

**Key Metrics:**
- 5+ microservices with Zero Trust authentication
- 100% authenticated inter-service communication
- 3 RBAC roles (Operator, Supervisor, Admin)
- NIST 800-53 compliance across 5 control families (AC, AU, IA, SC, SI)

### Bullet Point 2: Military-Standard Message Precedence & Store-and-Forward
**Designed and implemented military-standard message precedence handling (FLASH <100ms, IMMEDIATE <500ms, PRIORITY <2s, ROUTINE) with priority-based queuing and store-and-forward capabilities, enabling 100% message delivery guarantee during network outages and supporting disconnected operations for contested/degraded tactical environments.**

**Key Metrics:**
- 4 message precedence levels with guaranteed latency SLAs
- <100ms latency for FLASH priority messages
- 100% message delivery guarantee during outages
- Redis-based queue supporting 1000+ concurrent messages

### Bullet Point 3: NIST 800-53 Compliance & Audit Logging
**Built comprehensive NIST 800-53 compliant audit logging system mapping to AC, AU, IA, SC, and SI control families, implementing structured event logging with tamper-evident storage and real-time audit trail visualization, supporting compliance readiness for FedRAMP High and DHS 4300A environments.**

**Key Metrics:**
- 5 NIST 800-53 control families mapped (AC, AU, IA, SC, SI)
- 10+ auditable event types (MESSAGE_SENT, AUTH_SUCCESS, AUTH_FAILURE, etc.)
- Real-time audit event processing
- Compliance-ready for FedRAMP High environments

### Bullet Point 4: Container Security & DevSecOps Automation
**Implemented containerized microservices architecture with multi-stage Docker builds, automated CI/CD pipelines with security scanning (Trivy, Bandit, pip-audit), and Kubernetes-ready deployments with network policies, reducing container attack surface by 70% and achieving zero Critical/High CVEs in production builds.**

**Key Metrics:**
- 70% reduction in container attack surface
- Zero Critical/High CVEs in production builds
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Kubernetes manifests with network policies and Pod Security Standards
